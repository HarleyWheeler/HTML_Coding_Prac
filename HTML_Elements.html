        An element is everything between the the start and end tag.
    </p>

    <h1>
        Nested HTML Elements
    </h1>
    <p>
        Elements can contain other elements, such as p being contained within h1, within body, within html
    </p>

    <h1>
        Never skip the end tag
    </h1>
    <p>
        Even though some HTML elements will display without end tags, it is bad practice to not include end tags.
    </p>

    <h1>
        Empty HTML elements
    </h1>
    <p>
        Tags such as breaks <br> can be inserted mid-line <br> <br> to separate items.
        <br> <br>
        Tags are not case sensitive, so something like either 'p' or 'P' could be used.
    </p>

<!-- I learned that in VSCode you can just type 'h1' 'p' etc and it will fill in the brackets. Also, the quick key for entering comments is ctrl + /, just as with Python. -->
